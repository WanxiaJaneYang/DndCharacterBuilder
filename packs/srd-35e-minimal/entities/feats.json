For example, a fighter with a Dexterity of 15 can make a total \nof three attacks of opportunity in 1 round鈥攖he one attack of \nopportunity any character is entitled to, plus two more because of \nhis +2 Dexterity bonus. If four goblins move out of the character鈥檚 \nthreatened squares, he can make one attack of opportunity each \nagainst three of the four. You can still make only one attack of \nopportunity per opportunity. \nWith this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while \nflat-footed. \nNormal: A character without this feat can make only one attack \nof opportunity per round and can鈥檛 make attacks of opportunity \nwhile flat-footed. \nSpecial: The Combat Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use \nher opportunist ability (see page 51) more than once per round. \nA fighter may select Combat Reflexes as one of his fighter bonus \nfeats (see page 38) \nA monk may select Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat at 2nd level. \n \nCRAFT MAGIC ARMS AND ARMOR \n[ITEM CREATION] \nYou can create magic weapons, armor, and shields. \nPrerequisite: Caster level 5th. \nBenefit: You can create any magic weapon, armor, or shield \nwhose prerequisites you meet (see the Dungeon Master鈥檚 Guide  for \nprerequisites and other information on these items).

A spell whose casting time is more than 1 full-round \naction cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot \nfour levels higher than the spell鈥檚 actual level. Casting a quickened \nspell doesn鈥檛 provoke an attack of opportunity. \nSpecial: This feat can鈥檛 be applied to any spell cast spontaneously \n(including sorcerer spells, bard spells, and cleric or druid spells cast \nspontaneously), since applying a metamagic feat to a spontaneously \ncast spell automatically increases the casting time to a full-round \naction. \nCHAPTER 5: \nFEATS \n\n \n \n99\nRAPID RELOAD \n[GENERAL]\n \nChoose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy). You can reload a \ncrossbow of that type more quickly than normal. \nPrerequisite: Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen). \nBenefit: The time required for you to reload your chosen type of \ncrossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or \na move action (for a heavy crossbow). \nReloading a crossbow still \nprovokes an attack of oppor-\ntunity. \nIf you have selected this \nfeat for hand \ncrossbow or light \ncrossbow, you \nmay fire that \nweapon as \nmany \ntimes in a full attack \naction as you could \nattack if you were using a \nbow. \nNormal: A character with-\nout this feat needs a move \naction to reload a hand or \nlight crossbow, or a full-\nround action to reload a \nheavy crossbow.  \nSpecial: You can gain Rapid \nReload multiple times. Each \ntime you take the feat, it applies \nto a new type of crossbow. \nA fighter may select Rapid \nReload as one of his fighter \nbonus feats (see page 38). \n \nRAPID SHOT \n[GENERAL]\n \nYou can use ranged \nweapons with exceptional \nspeed. \nPrerequisites: Dex 13, Point \nBlank Shot. \nBenefit: You can get one extra attack per \nround with a ranged weapon. The attack is at your \nhighest base attack bonus, but each attack you \nmake in that round (the extra one and the normal \nones) takes a 鈥? penalty. You must use the full \nattack action (see page 143) to use this feat. \nSpecial: A fighter may select Rapid Shot as one \nof his fighter bonus feats (see page 38). \nA 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the archery \ncombat style is treated as having Rapid Shot, even \nif he does not have the prerequisites for it, but \nonly when he is wearing light or no armor (see \npage 48). \n \nRIDE-BY ATTACK \n[GENERAL]\n \nYou are skilled at making fast attacks for your \nmount. \nPrerequisites: Ride 1 rank, Mounted \nCombat. \nBenefit: When you are \nmounted and use the charge \naction, you may move and attack as \nif with a standard charge and then move again (continuing the \nstraight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round can鈥檛 \nexceed double your mounted speed. You and your mount do not \nprovoke an attack of opportunity from the opponent that you attack. \nSpecial: A fighter may select Ride-By Attack as one of his fighter \nbonus feats (see page 38). \n \nRUN \n[GENERAL]\n \nYou are fleet of foot. \nBenefit: When run-\nning, you move five times \nyour normal speed (if \nwearing medium, light \nor no armor and carry-\ning no more than a me- \ndium load) or 4 times\nnormal speed (if wearing\nheavy armor or carry-\ning a heavy load).\n         If you \nmake a jump after a \nrunning start (see \nthe Jump skill des-\ncription, page 77), you \ngain a +4 bonus on your \nJump check. While run-\nning, you retain your Dex-\nterity bonus to AC. \nNormal: You move four \ntimes your speed while \nrunning (if wearing light \nmedium or no armor and\ncarrying no more than a\nmedium load) or three\ntimes your speed (if wearing\nheavy armor or carrying a heavy \nload), and you lose your Dexterity \nbonus to AC. \n \nSCRIBE SCROLL \n[ITEM CREATION]\n \nYou can create scrolls, from which \nyou or another spellcaster can cast \nthe scribed spells. See the Dungeon \nMaster鈥檚 Guide for rules on scrolls. \nPrerequisite: Caster level 1st. \nBenefit: You can create a scroll \nof any spell that you know. \nScribing a scroll takes one day \nfor each 1,000 gp in its base \nprice. The base price of a \nscroll is its spell level 脳 its \ncaster level 脳 25 gp. To scribe \na scroll, you must spend \n1/25 of this base price in XP \nand use up raw materials \ncosting one-half of this base \nprice. \nAny scroll that stores a spell \nwith a costly material \ncomponent or an XP cost \nalso carries a commen-\nsurate cost. In addition to \nthe costs derived from the \nM\nialee casts a spell from\na scroll she scribed. \nCHAPTER 5: \nFEATS\n \n\n \n 100 \nbase price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP \nwhen scribing the scroll.",
