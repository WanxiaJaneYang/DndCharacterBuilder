A defender \nwho fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before \nyour next action). See glossary (page 313) for effects of being\nstunned.                                   You may attempt a\nstunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained \n(but see Special), and no more than once per round.

A monk who \nselects this feat may attempt a stunning attack a number of times per \nday equal to her monk level, plus one more time per day for every \nfour levels she has in classes other than monk. \nA fighter may select Stunning Fist as one of his fighter bonus \nfeats (see page 38). \n \nTOUGHNESS \n[GENERAL]\n \nYou are tougher than normal. \nBenefit: You gain +3 hit points. \nSpecial: A character may gain this feat multiple times. Its effects \nstack. \n \nTOWER SHIELD PROFICIENCY \n[GENERAL]\n \nYou are proficient with tower shields. \nPrerequisite: Shield Proficiency. \nBenefit: You can use a tower shield and suffer only the standard \npenalties (see Table 7-: Armor and Shields, page 123). \nNormal: A character who is using a shield with which he or she \nis not proficient takes the shield's armor check penalty on attack \nrolls and on all skill checks that involve moving, including Ride. \nSpecial: Fighters automatically have Tower Shield Proficiency as \na bonus feat. They need not select it. \n \nTRACK \n[GENERAL]\n \nYou can follow the trails of creatures and characters across most \ntypes of terrain. \nBenefit: To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a \nsuccessful Survival check. You must make another Survival check \nevery time the tracks become difficult to follow, such as when other \ntracks cross them or when the tracks backtrack and diverge. \nYou move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed \nwith a - penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed \nwith a -0 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface \nand the prevailing conditions, as given on the table below: \n \nSurface Survival DC Surface Survival DC \nVery soft ground 5 Firm ground 15 \nSoft ground 10 Hard ground 20\n \n \nVery Soft Ground:  Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) \nthat holds deep, clear impressions of footprints. \nSoft Ground:  Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but \nfirmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves \nfrequent but shallow footprints. \nFirm Ground: Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, \nwoods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces \n(thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave \nsome traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only \noccasional or partial footprints. \nHard Ground: Any surface that doesnn't hold footprints at all, such \nas bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this \ncategory, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed \naway. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced \npebbles).  \nSeveral modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the \ntable below. \n \nCondition Survival DC Modifier \nEvery three creatures in the group being tracked - \nSize of creature or creatures being tracked:\n1\n  \nFine +8 \nDiminutive +4 \nTiny +2 \nSmall +1 \nMedium +0 \nLarge - \nHuge - \nGargantuan - \nColossal - \nEvery 24 hours since the trail was made +1 \nEvery hour of rain since the trail was made +1 \nFresh snow cover since the trail was made +10 \nPoor visibility:\n2\n  \nOvercast or moonless night +6 \nMoonlight +3 \nFog or precipitation +3 \nTracked party hides trail (and moves at half speed) +5 \n1 For a group of mixed sizes, apply only the modifier for the largest size \ncategory. \n2 Apply only the largest modifier from this category.\n \n \nIf you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or \n10 minutes (indoors) of searching. \nNormal: Without this feat, you can use the Survival skill to find \ntracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or \nlower. Alternatively, you can use the Search skill to find a footprint \nor similar sign of a creature's passage using the DCs given above, but \nyou cann't use Search to follow tracks, even if someone else has \nalready found them. \nSpecial: A ranger automatically has Track as a bonus feat. He \nneed not select it. \nThis feat does not allow you to find or follow the tracks made by a \nsubject of a pass without trace spell. \n \nTRAMPLE \n[GENERAL]\n \nYou are trained in using your mount to knock down opponents. \nPrerequisites: Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat. \nCHAPTER 5: \nFEATS\n \n\n \n 102 \nBenefit: When you attempt to overrun an opponent while \nmounted, your target may not choose to avoid you. Your mount may \nmake one hoof attack against any target you knock down, gaining \nthe standard +4 bonus on attack rolls against prone targets (see \nOverrun, page 157). \nSpecial: A fighter may select Trample as one of his fighter bonus \nfeats (see page 38).",

A defender \nwho fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before \nyour next action). See glossary (page 313) for effects of being\nstunned.                                   You may attempt a\nstunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained \n(but see Special), and no more than once per round. Constructs, \noozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune \nto critical hits cannot be stunned. \nSpecial: A monk may select Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st \nlevel, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. A monk who \nselects this feat may attempt a stunning attack a number of times per \nday equal to her monk level, plus one more time per day for every \nfour levels she has in classes other than monk. \nA fighter may select Stunning Fist as one of his fighter bonus \nfeats (see page 38). \n \nTOUGHNESS \n[GENERAL]\n \nYou are tougher than normal. \nBenefit: You gain +3 hit points. \nSpecial: A character may gain this feat multiple times.

They need not select it. \n \nTRACK \n[GENERAL]\n \nYou can follow the trails of creatures and characters across most \ntypes of terrain. \nBenefit: To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a \nsuccessful Survival check. You must make another Survival check \nevery time the tracks become difficult to follow, such as when other \ntracks cross them or when the tracks backtrack and diverge. \nYou move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed \nwith a - penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed \nwith a -0 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface \nand the prevailing conditions, as given on the table below: \n \nSurface Survival DC Surface Survival DC \nVery soft ground 5 Firm ground 15 \nSoft ground 10 Hard ground 20\n \n \nVery Soft Ground:  Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) \nthat holds deep, clear impressions of footprints. \nSoft Ground:  Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but \nfirmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves \nfrequent but shallow footprints. \nFirm Ground: Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, \nwoods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces \n(thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave \nsome traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only \noccasional or partial footprints. \nHard Ground: Any surface that doesnn't hold footprints at all, such \nas bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this \ncategory, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed \naway. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced \npebbles).  \nSeveral modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the \ntable below. \n \nCondition Survival DC Modifier \nEvery three creatures in the group being tracked - \nSize of creature or creatures being tracked:\n1\n  \nFine +8 \nDiminutive +4 \nTiny +2 \nSmall +1 \nMedium +0 \nLarge - \nHuge - \nGargantuan - \nColossal - \nEvery 24 hours since the trail was made +1 \nEvery hour of rain since the trail was made +1 \nFresh snow cover since the trail was made +10 \nPoor visibility:\n2\n  \nOvercast or moonless night +6 \nMoonlight +3 \nFog or precipitation +3 \nTracked party hides trail (and moves at half speed) +5 \n1 For a group of mixed sizes, apply only the modifier for the largest size \ncategory. \n2 Apply only the largest modifier from this category.\n \n \nIf you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or \n10 minutes (indoors) of searching. \nNormal: Without this feat, you can use the Survival skill to find \ntracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or \nlower. Alternatively, you can use the Search skill to find a footprint \nor similar sign of a creature's passage using the DCs given above, but \nyou cann't use Search to follow tracks, even if someone else has \nalready found them. \nSpecial: A ranger automatically has Track as a bonus feat. He \nneed not select it. \nThis feat does not allow you to find or follow the tracks made by a \nsubject of a pass without trace spell. \n \nTRAMPLE \n[GENERAL]\n \nYou are trained in using your mount to knock down opponents. \nPrerequisites: Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat. \nCHAPTER 5: \nFEATS\n \n\n \n 102 \nBenefit: When you attempt to overrun an opponent while \nmounted, your target may not choose to avoid you. Your mount may \nmake one hoof attack against any target you knock down, gaining \nthe standard +4 bonus on attack rolls against prone targets (see \nOverrun, page 157). \nSpecial: A fighter may select Trample as one of his fighter bonus \nfeats (see page 38).",
