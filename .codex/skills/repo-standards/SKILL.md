# Repo Standards

1. Inspect repository state first (`git status`, current branch, pending local changes).
2. Keep changes minimal and aligned with existing style and architecture.
3. Run relevant validation for touched areas (format, lint, typecheck, tests).
4. Update docs/README when commands, workflows, or behavior change.
5. Summarize what changed, what was validated, and any remaining risk.
