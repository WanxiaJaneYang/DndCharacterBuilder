# UX Documentation Hub

This folder contains documents describing the user experience of the DnDCharacterBuilder. Each document focuses on different aspects of the journey and details how users interact with the product.

## Contents

- `JOURNEY_OVERVIEW.md` – an end‑to‑end description of the user's journey through the wizard.
- `steps/` – detailed descriptions of each wizard step (including `00_role_selection.md` for initial DM/Player entry).
- `edge_cases/` – documentation on how the product handles uncommon or complex situations (e.g., resetting the wizard or conflicting rule packs).

## Writing UX Docs

When writing a UX doc:

1. Start with the goal of the step or interaction.
2. Describe the primary user intent and any secondary intents.
3. Outline the UI layout at a high level (refer to Figma for exact design).
4. List the data required (entities, stats, etc.).
5. Describe validation rules and error states.
6. Include acceptance criteria for design and implementation.

## To‑Do

- Create additional edge case docs (e.g., multi‑class selection).
- Iterate on step descriptions based on user testing feedback.
- Add wireframes or Figma links once designs are complete.
